# Movie App
OAMK (Oulu University of Applied Sciences) second year studies include making a react web application. The application utilizes API calls from a third-party movie database TMDB, and uses it's own database for storing user- and group data.

This repository is a duplicate of the private repository that our group made for the project. The only difference is this README -file.

## My contributions
My (Santeri Hyry) biggest contribution was frontend and backend functionalities for group views. I wrote the components for getting all relevant data from the database, and displaying them to the user. 
The program also makes checks to see if the user is logged in, group member, or group admin, and changes displayed components accordingly.

## Requirements that have been met
* User creation and deletion
* User login
* Custom group creation
* Admin privileges like adding or removing users
* Sharing content with group
* Movie search function
* Movie review publishing and browsing




## Project
The project was made as a react app. The app has it's own SQL database done with PostgreSQL. The website is hosted on render.com. 

## Software used
Visual Studio Code, PostgreSQL, Postman
