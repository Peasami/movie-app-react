# Movie App
### Link to the website: https://movie-app-h3st.onrender.com/
The website might not work correctly depending if backend is still running.

## info
OAMK (Oulu University of Applied Sciences) second year studies include making a react web application. The application utilizes API calls from a third-party movie database TMDB, and uses it's own database for storing user- and group data.

This repository is a duplicate of the private repository that our group made for the project. The only difference is this README -file.

## Used technologies
* Frontend with **React**
* Backend with **Node.js**
* Database with **PostgreSQL**

## My contributions
My biggest contribution to this project was the frontend and backend functionalities for group views. I wrote the components for getting all relevant data from the database, and displaying them to the user. 
The program also makes checks to see if the user is logged in, group member, or group admin, and changes displayed components accordingly.

## Working functionalities
* User creation and deletion
* User login
* Custom group creation
* Admin privileges like adding or removing users
* Sharing content with group
* Movie search function
* Movie review publishing and browsing


## Software used
Visual Studio Code, PostgreSQL, Postman
